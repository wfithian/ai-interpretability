    "text": "About\nThis reading group is organized around a single, demanding question:\n\nWhat kinds of interpretability claims are meaningful, reliable, and decision-relevant as AI systems become more capable, opaque, and strategically situated?\n\nThe course is not a general survey of explainable AI, nor an attempt to catalog interpretability techniques. Instead, it treats interpretability as a scientific and safety-relevant practice: a collection of methods, epistemic standards, and theory-of-change assumptions aimed at gaining traction on the internal structure of modern ML systems in ways that could plausibly matter for oversight, control, and alignment.\nThe reading group is intentionally interdisciplinary, bringing together perspectives from machine learning, statistics, causal inference, philosophy of science, cognitive science, and AI governance. A core goal is to establish shared evaluative standards across these communities—standards for what counts as evidence, explanation, robustness, and limitation in interpretability research."

    "text": "Part II: Methods, Interventions, and Internal Structure\nThe middle of the course focuses on what interpretability methods actually allow us to do with real models. The emphasis is on intervention-oriented mechanistic work. Throughout this section, participants are encouraged to track an implicit question: When does an intervention support an explanatory claim, and when is it merely a control knob?\n\nWeek 5 — Steering Vectors\n\nSteering Language Models With Activation Engineering (2023)\n\nAlexander Matt Turner et al.\n\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10248\n\n\nActivation Addition (ActAdd): inference-time steering by adding activation-space directions computed from prompt pairs; foundational steering method.\n\n\nWeek 6 — Behavioral Directions and Internal State Variables\n\nRefusal in Language Models Is Mediated by a Single Direction (2024)\n\nYoni Arditi, Neel Nanda et al.\n\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07896\n\nPersona Vectors: Monitoring and Steering Model Behavior (2025)\n\nAnthropic Interpretability Team\n\n\nhttps://www.anthropic.com/research/persona-vectors\n\n\nTogether, these readings show that important model behaviors can be mediated by low-dimensional structure in activation space. The refusal paper provides a crisp mechanistic result for a single high-stakes behavior, while persona vectors generalize this idea to broader, more persistent behavioral traits and recast interpretability as monitoring and oversight infrastructure. This week sets up later discussions about robustness, abstraction, and the limits of behavioral interpretability.\n\n\nWeek 7 — Machine Unlearning\n\nTOFU: A Task of Fictitious Unlearning for LLMs (2024)\n\nPratyush Maini et al.\n\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06121\n\n\nBenchmark + evaluation suite for LLM unlearning; clarifies what it would mean to behave as if certain data were never learned.\n\n\nWeek 8 — Latent Knowledge\n\nDiscovering Latent Knowledge in Language Models Without Supervision (ICLR 2023; arXiv 2022)\n\nCollin Burns et al.\n\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03827\n\n\nExtracts truth-related structure from activations to separate what models know from what they say; foundational for oversight.\n\n\nWeek 9 — Causal Scrubbing\n\nCausal Scrubbing: A Method for Rigorously Testing Mechanistic Interpretability Hypotheses (2022)\n\nLawrence Chan et al.\n\n\nhttps://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/JvZhhzycHu2Yd57RN/causal-scrubbing-a-method-for-rigorously-testing\n\n\nBehavior-preserving resampling ablations as a principled way to test mechanistic hypotheses (interpretation → falsifiable causal claim).\n\n\nWeek 10 — Large-Scale Mechanistic Interpretability\n\nOn the Biology of a Large Language Model (2025)\n\nAnthropic Interpretability Team\n\n\nhttps://www.anthropic.com/research/biology-of-a-large-language-model\n\n\nPresents Anthropic’s most ambitious attempt to construct detailed mechanistic explanations of a frontier language model, tracing behavior through features, circuits, and attribution graphs. This paper serves as a flagship example of large-scale mechanistic interpretability in practice. Read in light of causal scrubbing, this week focuses on evaluating which parts of the explanatory narrative are causally supported, which rely on weaker forms of evidence, and what standards should govern claims of “understanding” at scale."

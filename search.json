The refusal paper provides a crisp mechanistic result for a single high-stakes behavior, while persona vectors generalize this idea to broader, more persistent behavioral traits and recast interpretability as monitoring and oversight infrastructure. This week sets up later discussions about robustness, abstraction, and the limits of behavioral interpretability.\n\n\nWeek 7 — Machine Unlearning\n\nTOFU: A Task of Fictitious Unlearning for LLMs (2024)\n\nPratyush Maini et al.\n\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06121\n\n\nBenchmark and evaluation suite for LLM unlearning; clarifies what it would mean to behave as if certain data were never learned.\n\n\nWeek 8 — Latent Knowledge\n\nDiscovering Latent Knowledge in Language Models Without Supervision (ICLR 2023; arXiv 2022)\n\nCollin Burns et al.\n\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03827\n\n\nExtracts truth-related structure from activations to separate what models know from what they say; foundational for oversight.\n\n\nWeek 9 — Causal Scrubbing\n\nCausal Scrubbing: A Method for Rigorously Testing Mechanistic Interpretability Hypotheses (2022)\n\nLawrence Chan et al.\n\n\nhttps://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/JvZhhzycHu2Yd57RN/causal-scrubbing-a-method-for-rigorously-testing\n\n\nBehavior-preserving resampling ablations as a principled way to test mechanistic hypotheses (interpretation as a falsifiable causal claim).\n\n\nWeek 10 — Large-Scale Mechanistic Interpretability\n\nOn the Biology of a Large Language Model (2025)\n\nAnthropic Interpretability Team\n\n\nhttps://www.anthropic.com/research/biology-of-a-large-language-model\n\n\nAnthropic’s most ambitious attempt to construct detailed mechanistic explanations of a frontier language model, tracing behavior through features, circuits, and attribution graphs."

Develops formal criteria for abstraction-preserving interventions and shows that many mechanistic stories fail to license the explanations they appear to offer.\n\n\nWeek 15 — Interpretability and Existential Risk\n\nIs Power-Seeking AI an Existential Risk? (2022–2024), selected sections\n\nJoseph Carlsmith\n\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13353\n\n\nSituates interpretability within alignment, governance, and long-term AI risk."

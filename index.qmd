## Logistics

**Format:** We will read 1--2 papers per week; one group member will lead a 45-minute presentation followed by group discussion.

**Organizers:** Will Fithian (Statistics), Wes Holliday (Philosophy), and Sean Richardson (Statistics PhD student)

**Meeting Details:** Fridays 1-2:30pm, in Latimer 120.

**Course credit:** We can enroll a limited number of students in [Stat 298 (section 3)](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2026-spring-stat-298-003-ind-003) for 2 units of course credit. The requirement for course credit is regular attendance plus presenting a paper at one session. The course listing will appear in the course catalog within a few days.


## Description

This is an interdisciplinary reading group organized around the question:

> **What kinds of interpretability claims are meaningful, useful, and reliable as AI systems become more capable and are deployed in higher-stakes contexts?**

We will study interpretability as a *scientific and safety-relevant practice*: a collection of methods, epistemic standards, and theory-of-change assumptions aimed at gaining traction on the internal structure of modern ML systems in ways that could plausibly matter for oversight, control, and alignment. Questions include:

- Why study interpretability? How do we formulate interpretability claims rigorously, and assess evidence for and against?
- How are interpretability methods currently used to understand and steer state-of-the-art systems? How do we know if they are working?
- What are the limitations of these methods, or of the interpretability paradigm more broadly? What role can it play in reducing risks to society?

Our aim is to bring together an interdisciplinary community including perspectives from machine learning, statistics, causal inference, philosophy of science, and AI governance, and to seed new research programs.

### Learning objectives
By the end of this course, participants should be able to:

1. **Distinguish** different senses of "interpretability" and "understanding"
2. **Evaluate** mechanistic claims in light of causal and robustness criteria
3. **Recognize** when interpretability evidence is strong, weak, or misleading
4. **Articulate and critique** realistic theories of change connecting interpretability to AI risk mitigation

### Assumed background

We welcome broad interdisciplinary participation, but our curriculum is designed for participants with:

- Comfort reading technical ML papers
- Interest in evaluating interpretability claims critically
- Background in one or more relevant fields such as statistics, philosophy, causal inference, or cognitive science

No prior interpretability research experience is required.


## Tentative Reading Schedule

The reading list below may be revised according to participant interests.

### Part I: Meaning (Weeks 1–4)

*What is interpretability for? What kinds of questions can it answer? How do mechanistic explanations differ from post-hoc rationalizations?*

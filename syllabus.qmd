The course follows the arc of its title:

- **Part I: Meaning and Orientation** (Weeks 1–3) — What is interpretability for? What kinds of questions can it answer?
- **Part II: Methods, Interventions, and Internal Structure** (Weeks 4–10) — What can we actually do with real models, and what kinds of causal claims follow?
- **Part III: Limits, Evaluation, and Stakes** (Weeks 11–15) — When does interpretability work, and what role should it play in mitigating AI risk?

The schedule below is tentative. Please do not hesitate to contact Will Fithian ([wfithian@berkeley.edu](mailto:wfithian@berkeley.edu)) or Wes Holliday ([wesholliday@berkeley.edu](mailto:wesholliday@berkeley.edu)) if you have additional papers or topics to suggest.

## Part I: Meaning and Orientation

### Week 1 — Framing Interpretability

**Towards a Rigorous Science of Interpretable Machine Learning** (2017)
: Finale Doshi-Velez & Been Kim
: <https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08608>

*Introduces a taxonomy of interpretability goals, audiences, and evaluation criteria; frames interpretability as an epistemic problem.*

### Week 2 — Mechanistic Interpretability and Circuits

**Zoom In: Circuits** (2020)
: Chris Olah et al.
: <https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/>

*Canonical introduction to mechanistic interpretability, circuit-based explanations, and feature-level analysis.*

### Week 3 — Interpretability as a Safety Strategy

**Neel Nanda** (2025)

- *A Pragmatic Vision for Interpretability*
  <https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/StENzDcD3kpfGJssR/a-pragmatic-vision-for-interpretability>
- *How Can Interpretability Researchers Help AGI Go Well?*
  <https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/MnkeepcGirnJn736j/how-can-interpretability-researchers-help-agi-go-well>

*Agenda-setting essays that articulate a pragmatic, safety-oriented theory of change for interpretability research.*

## Part II: Methods, Interventions, and Internal Structure

### Week 4 — Causal Intervention in Practice

**Locating and Editing Factual Associations in GPT** (NeurIPS 2022)
: Kevin Meng et al.
: <https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05262>
: Project page: <https://rome.baulab.info/>

*ROME: causal tracing to identify where factual associations live in transformer computation, and targeted weight editing to modify them.*


### Week 5 — Steering Vectors

**Steering Language Models With Activation Engineering** (2023)
: Alexander Matt Turner et al.
: <https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10248>

*Activation Addition (ActAdd): inference-time steering by adding activation-space directions computed from prompt pairs; foundational steering method.*

### Week 6 — Behavioral Directions and Internal State Variables

**Refusal in Language Models Is Mediated by a Single Direction** (2024)
: Yoni Arditi, Neel Nanda et al.
: <https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07896>

**Persona Vectors: Monitoring and Steering Model Behavior** (2025)
: Anthropic Interpretability Team
: <https://www.anthropic.com/research/persona-vectors>

*Together, these readings show that important model behaviors can be mediated by low-dimensional structure in activation space. The refusal paper provides a crisp mechanistic result for a single high-stakes behavior, while persona vectors generalize this idea to broader, more persistent behavioral traits and recast interpretability as monitoring and oversight infrastructure. This week sets up later discussions about robustness, abstraction, and the limits of behavioral interpretability.*

### Week 7 — Machine Unlearning

**TOFU: A Task of Fictitious Unlearning for LLMs** (2024)
: Pratyush Maini et al.
: <https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06121>

*Benchmark and evaluation suite for LLM unlearning; clarifies what it would mean to behave as if certain data were never learned.*

### Week 8 — Latent Knowledge

**Discovering Latent Knowledge in Language Models Without Supervision** (ICLR 2023; arXiv 2022)
: Collin Burns et al.
: <https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03827>

*Extracts truth-related structure from activations to separate what models know from what they say; foundational for oversight.*

### Week 9 — Causal Scrubbing

**Causal Scrubbing: A Method for Rigorously Testing Mechanistic Interpretability Hypotheses** (2022)
: Lawrence Chan et al.
: <https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/JvZhhzycHu2Yd57RN/causal-scrubbing-a-method-for-rigorously-testing>

*Behavior-preserving resampling ablations as a principled way to test mechanistic hypotheses (interpretation as a falsifiable causal claim).*

### Week 10 — Large-Scale Mechanistic Interpretability

**On the Biology of a Large Language Model** (2025)
: Anthropic Interpretability Team
: <https://www.anthropic.com/research/biology-of-a-large-language-model>

*Anthropic's most ambitious attempt to construct detailed mechanistic explanations of a frontier language model, tracing behavior through features, circuits, and attribution graphs.*

## Part III: Limits, Evaluation, and Stakes

### Week 11 — Mesa-Optimization and Deceptive Alignment

**Risks from Learned Optimization in Advanced ML Systems** (2019)
: Evan Hubinger et al.
: <https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01820>

*Classic account of mesa-optimization and deceptive alignment; essential for understanding interpretability's limits.*

### Week 12 — Deceptive Interpretability

**Deceptive Automated Interpretability: Language Models Coordinating to Fool Oversight Systems** (2025)
: Simon Lermen, Mateusz Dziemian, Natalia Pérez-Campanero Antolín
: <https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07831>

*Shows how models/agents can produce deceptive explanations that evade automated interpretability-based oversight; stress-tests interpretability as safety infrastructure.*

### Week 13 — Philosophy of Causal Explanation

**Making Things Happen** (2003), selected chapters
: James Woodward

*Philosophical grounding for causal explanation and intervention.*

### Week 14 — Causal Abstractions

**Causal Abstractions of Neural Networks** (2023)
: Atticus Geiger, DeepMind et al.
: <https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02536>

*Asks whether mechanistic interpretability explanations support valid higher-level causal abstractions. Develops formal criteria for abstraction-preserving interventions and shows that many mechanistic stories fail to license the explanations they appear to offer.*

### Week 15 — Interpretability and Existential Risk

**Is Power-Seeking AI an Existential Risk?** (2022–2024), selected sections
: Joseph Carlsmith
: <https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13353>

## About

This reading group brings together researchers from multiple disciplines to develop a shared, rigorous understanding of AI interpretability—both as a scientific enterprise and as a potential tool for managing the risks posed by increasingly capable AI systems.

The group emphasizes *pragmatic mechanistic interpretability*: methods that make concrete, testable claims about how models work internally, and that plausibly contribute to oversight, control, and alignment.

Rather than surveying the literature broadly, the course is structured around **one substantial reading per week**, allowing participants to engage deeply with each work. The readings combine foundational papers that establish shared vocabulary with recent (2023–2025) frontier research on steering, model editing and unlearning, robustness under distribution shift, and the limits of interpretability in the presence of deception.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, participants will be able to:

1. **Identify** what kind of explanation an interpretability paper offers
2. **Evaluate** the robustness and validity of interpretability claims
3. **Understand** how interpretability research connects to AI safety and alignment
4. **Recognize** open problems and promising research directions
5. **Apply** critical reasoning from multiple disciplines (ML, statistics, philosophy, causal inference) to interpretability research

## Course Structure

The course is organized into three sections reflecting a progression from *understanding* to *control* to *limits*:

- **Part I: Foundations & Orientation** (Weeks 1–4) — Conceptual grounding, mechanistic methods, and strategic goals
- **Part II: Intervention, Control, and Robustness** (Weeks 5–11) — What we can do to models and how to evaluate it
- **Part III: Failure Modes, Explanation, and Alignment** (Weeks 12–15) — When interpretability breaks and how it fits into AI risk
